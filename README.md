# vts-browser-cpp

[vts-browser-cpp](https://github.com/melown/vts-browser-cpp) is a library
that brings vts map capabilities to your native c++ applications.

## Design & Features

- simple -> minimalistic Qt based application using this library has about 800 LOC.
- clean c++11 classfull api
- rendering api independent -> the library, on its own, does not render anything, it just tells the application what to render

## WIP

Be warned, this library is still in early state of development.
We make no attempt on maintaining ABI nor API compatibility at this moment.
