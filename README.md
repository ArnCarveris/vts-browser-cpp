# VTS Browser CPP

[VTS Browser CPP](https://github.com/melown/vts-browser-cpp) is a library
that brings VTS capabilities to your native c++ applications.

## Design & Features

- Simple -> Minimalistic opengl application using this library has about 150 LOC.
- Clean c++11 classfull API.
- Highly flexible -> almost all aspects can be changed through configuration or callbacks.
- Rendering API independent -> The library, on its own, does not render anything.
Instead, it just tells the application what to render.
However, a convenient opengl-based rendering library is also provided.

## WIP

Be warned, this library is still in development.
We make no attempt on maintaining ABI nor API compatibility yet.
